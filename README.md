# A repository to study complexity economics by means of multi-agent reinforcement learning!

## Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning:

## Interesting starting points:
 ### Quick recessions vs. slow recoveries
 Business cycles are not symmetric; if you flipped the time-series data upside-down the fluctuations would look different. Recessions are usually quick; recoveries are usually slow.
 This phenomenon can be explained through a excess demand for money within a simple model of a monetary exchange economy.

  Questions: 
  - Can the Wicksellian-Triangle be modeled as a MARL-learning problem?
  - Will MARL agents eventually learn to trade multilaterally?
  - Emergent usage of money?
  - What are the potential drivers for an excess demand for money if the preference for holding money is part of the 
  learning problem?
